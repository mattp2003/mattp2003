## Welcome to my digital playground! ðŸš€

Howdy ðŸ˜„ I'm Matthew Nhat Phan, and this is my personal GitHub page - a showroom of my exploration, creation, and contribution to fun projects. I'm currently studying at the University of California, Irvine, pursuring my major of Computer Science and Entrepreneurship. When it comes to coding, it's my passion to deliver the best practices, producing high-quality and clean code that is scalable.

# About Me

As an enthusiastic and ambitious student pursuing Computer Science undergraduate, Iâ€™ve gained a strong foundation in the software development lifecycle and data engineering through more than 3 years of academic projects and collaborative team experiences. I'm most interested in the study of data and the usage of making them extremely valuable for one specific entity. This includes engineering databases for scalability and tuning impactful Machine Learning models to provide valuable insights on the data. I'm familiar with technologies, such as Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, XGBoost, Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib/Seaborn.
